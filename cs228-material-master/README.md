## Material

This repo currently holds:

* A [tutorial](https://github.com/kuleshov/cs228-material/blob/master/tutorials/python/cs228-python-tutorial.ipynb) on basic Python/Numpy that is necesseary to get started with the above machine learning classes.

You may follow the iPython notebook on github, or clone and execute it locally.
